        "The process begins with the activity 'Draft Contract,' which involves creating the initial version of the contract with 'Contract Version' and 'Contract Status' attributes.\n",
        "#### **End Constraints**\n",
        "The process concludes with the activity 'Close Deal,' which involves finalizing the property transaction and completing all necessary paperwork. This activity must be the last to occur in the process and must be completed within 30 days.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Frequency Constraints**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Existence Constraint**\n",
        "The 'Review Contract' activity must occur at least once in the process. This ensures that the contract is examined for accuracy and completeness, adding depth and reliability to the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Flexible Ordering Constraints**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Precedence Constraints**\n",
        "1. The activity 'Approve Contract' is permitted to occur only if a 'Conduct Title Search' activity has occurred before it. The 'Conduct Title Search' activity must verify that the 'Contract Status is Reviewed' and the 'Title Search Result is Clear,' ensuring that the contract is thoroughly reviewed and the property ownership is legally verified before approval.\n",
        "2. The activity 'Negotiate Terms' is permitted to occur only if an 'Assess Property Value' activity has occurred before it, with the condition that the 'Property Value' is greater than 50,000. This ensures that the negotiation of terms is based on a valid and substantial property valuation.\n",
        "3. The activity 'Close Deal' is permitted to occur only if a 'Verify Funds' activity has occurred before it. The 'Verify Funds' activity must confirm that the 'Deal Status is Open' and that the 'Funds Verified' are greater than or equal to the 'Property Value,' ensuring financial readiness before finalizing the deal.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Response Constraints**\n",
        "1. If the 'Draft Contract' activity occurs with the condition 'Contract Status is Draft,' then the 'Review Contract' activity must occur within 2 days. This ensures a timely review of the drafted contract, maintaining the process's momentum.\n",
        "2. If the 'Sign Contract' activity occurs with the condition 'Contract Status is Signed,' then the 'Register Property' activity must occur with the condition 'Registration Status is Pending' within 5 days. This ensures that the property registration follows promptly after the contract is signed, maintaining the legal and procedural flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Succession Constraints**\n",
        "Whenever an 'Approve Contract' activity occurs with the condition 'Contract Status is Approved,' it must be immediately followed by a 'Sign Contract' activity with the condition 'Contract Status == Contract Status' within 1 day. This establishes a direct causal link between the approval and signing of the contract, ensuring a seamless progression in the process.\n",

        "The 'Sign Contract' activity and the 'Conduct Title Search' activity cannot both occur within the same process instance if the conditions 'Contract Status is Approved' and 'Title Search Result is Issues Found' are met. This exclusion ensures that a contract cannot be signed if the title search reveals issues, thereby maintaining the integrity of the process by preventing conflicting events.\n",

        "####15:\n",
        "Name: Co-Existence[Send Inquiry, Execute Demand] | | |\n",

        "Description: If 'Login' activity occurs in a process instance, then 'Logout' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance, either before or after the 'Login' event. If 'Login' does not occur, there is no requirement for 'Logout' to occur. Multiple occurrences of 'Login' are satisfied by at least one occurrence of 'Logout', and multiple 'Logout' instances are allowed.\n",
        "####18:\n",
        "Name: Response[Open Browser, Fill URL] | | |\n",
        "Description: If a 'Open Browser' activity occurs, then a 'Fill URL' activity must eventually occur after the 'Open Browser' event at some point in the same process instance. There is no requirement on how soon or what events may occur in between. Multiple 'Open Browser' can be pending at the same time, and a single 'Fill URL' can fulfill the obligation for all preceding 'Open Browser'. If 'Open Browser' does not occur, the constraint imposes no obligation on the occurrence of 'Fill URL'.\n",
        "####19:\n",
        "Name: Succession[Open Umbrella, Close Umbrella] | | |\n",
        "Description: A 'Open Umbrella' activity must be followed by a 'Close Umbrella' activity at some point later in the same process instance. Conversely, a 'Close Umbrella' event can occur only if an 'Open Umbrella' event has occurred before it within the same process instance. This bidirectional and ordered dependency ensures that 'Open Umbrella' impose obligations for future 'Close Umbrella', and 'Close Umbrella' cannot occur without prior 'Open Umbrella'. Multiple 'Open Umbrella' and 'Close Umbrella' are allowed, with each 'Open Umbrella' eventually leading to a 'Close Umbrella' and each 'Close Umbrella' being justified by a preceding 'Open Umbrella'.\n",
        "####20:\n",
        "Name: Not Chain Succession[Style Hair, Take a Shower] | | |\n",
        "Description: A 'Style Hair' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Take a Shower' activity; there must be at least one other event between them. Similarly, a 'Take a Shower' event cannot be immediately preceded by a 'Style Hair' event. This constraint allows multiple occurrences of 'Style Hair' and 'Take a Shower' in any order, provided they are not adjacent in the event sequence.\n",
        "####21:\n",
        "Name: Not Co-Existence[Go to Party, Stay at Home] | | |\n",
        "Description: The 'Go to Party' activity and the 'Stay at Home' activity cannot both occur within the same process instance. This means that if 'Go to Party' event occurs one or more times, 'Stay at Home' must not occur at all in that process instance, and vice-versa. It is acceptable for neither event to occur. The constraint enforces a mutual exclusion between 'Go to Party' and 'Stay at Home', allowing for different process variants based on which event (if any) occurs.\n",
        "####22:\n",
        "Name: Not Succession[Eat Food, Run] | | |\n",
        "Description: The 'Eat Food' activity and 'Run' activity must not occur such that the 'Eat Food' event is followed by the 'Run' event at any point later in the same process instance. Similarly, a 'Run' event must not be preceded by an 'Eat Food' event. This means that once an 'Eat Food' occurs, 'Run' cannot occur afterward, and if 'Run' event occurs, it cannot have been preceded by an 'Eat Food' event. Both events can occur in the same process instance, but not in the prohibited sequence.\n",
        "####23:\n",
        "Name: Not Chain Precedence[Order Confirmation, Order Placement] | | |\n",
        "Description: The 'Order Confirmation' activity cannot be directly preceded by an 'Order Placement' activity, meaning that a 'Order Confirmation' event cannot occur immediately after an 'Order Placement' without any intervening events.\n",
        "####24:\n",
        "Name: Not Chain Response[Submit Order, Confirm Order] | | |\n",
        "Description: The 'Submit Order' activity cannot be directly followed by a 'Confirm Order' activity, meaning that a 'Confirm Order' event cannot occur immediately after a 'Submit Order' without any intervening events.\n",
        "####25:\n",
        "Name: Not Precedence[Approve Order, Process Payment] | | |\n",
        "Description: A 'Process Payment' activity cannot be preceded by a 'Approve Order' within the same process instance. If a 'Approve Order' event has occurred at any point before a 'Process Payment' event, then 'Process Payment' is disallowed. Multiple instances of 'Process Payment' and 'Approve Order' can occur, but all instances of 'Process Payment' must occur before any instance of 'Approve Order'.\n",
        "####26:\n",
        "Name: Not Responded Existence[Submit Order, Cancel Order] | | |\n",
        "Description: If a 'Submit Order' activity occur in a process instance, then a 'Cancel Order' activity must not occur anywhere in the same process instance after the 'Submit Order' event. This means that the occurrence of 'Submit Order' event prohibits any subsequent occurrence of 'Cancel Order' event. However, if 'Submit Order' does not occur, 'Cancel Order' may occur freely. Multiple occurrences of 'Submit Order' are allowed, provided 'Cancel Order' does not occur at all in the process instance.\n",
        "####27:\n",
        "Constraint Template: Not Response[Submit Application, Reject Application] | | |\n",
        "Description: The 'Submit Application' activity must not be followed by a 'Reject Application' activity at any point later in the same process instance. This means that once a 'Submit Application' event occurs, 'Reject Application' cannot occur afterward. However, 'Reject Application' events occurring before the 'Submit Application' are permitted. The constraint ensures that after the occurrence of 'Submit Application', the process does not allow any further occurrences of 'Reject Application'.\n",
        "####28:\n",
        "Name: Choice[Receive Payment, Issue Refund] | | |\n",
        "Description: At least one of the activities 'Receive Payment' or 'Issue Refund' must occur in the process instance. This means that the process is compliant if 'Receive Payment' event occurs, 'Issue Refund' event occurs, or both occur. There is no restriction on the order or the number of times they occur. However, if neither 'Receive Payment' nor 'Issue Refund' occurs, the constraint is violated.\n",
        "####29:\n",
        "Name: Exclusive Choice[Approve Application, Reject Application] | | |\n",
        "Description: Exactly one of the activities 'Approve Application' or 'Reject Application' must occur in the process instance. This means that the process is compliant if only 'Approve Application' event occurs without any occurrence of 'Reject Application' event, or only 'Reject Application' occurs without any occurrence of 'Approve Application'. The process is non-compliant if both 'Approve Application' and 'Reject Application' occur, or if neither occurs. The constraint enforces a mutual exclusivity and a mandatory occurrence of one of the specified activities.\n",
