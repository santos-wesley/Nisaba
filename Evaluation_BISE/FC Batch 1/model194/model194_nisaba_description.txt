## Interleaved Description
The MP-Declare process model for the report management process is described as follows:

### **Trace-Related Constraints**

#### **Init Constraints**  
The process begins with the activity 'Gather Data,' which involves collecting relevant data for analysis. This activity is foundational as it sets the stage for the entire process by ensuring that the necessary data, identified by attributes 'Data ID' and 'Data Type,' is available for subsequent activities.

#### **End Constraints**  
The process concludes with the activity 'Publish Report,' which involves sharing the approved report with the intended audience. This activity must be the last to occur in the process, ensuring that all prior steps, including data analysis, report drafting, review, revision, and approval, are completed before the report is made public.

---

### **Flexible Ordering Constraints**

#### **Precedence Constraints**  
1. The activity 'Analyze Data' is permitted to occur only if a 'Gather Data' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This ensures that data analysis is based on previously collected data, maintaining logical consistency in the process.  
2. The activity 'Review Report' is permitted to occur only if a 'Draft Report' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This ensures that the review process is conducted on an existing draft, reinforcing the logical flow of the process.

#### **Response Constraints**  
1. Whenever an 'Analyze Data' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Draft Report' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. This ensures that the insights derived from data analysis are promptly documented in a draft report, maintaining a cohesive temporal structure in the process.  
2. If a 'Revise Report' activity occurs, then an 'Approve Report' activity must eventually occur after the 'Revise Report' event at some point in the same process instance. This must happen within 48 hours, ensuring that revisions are promptly followed by formal approval, maintaining the process's momentum.  
3. Whenever an 'Approve Report' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Publish Report' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. This must happen within 24 hours, ensuring that the approved report is promptly shared with the intended audience.

#### **Succession Constraints**  
1. Whenever a 'Review Report' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Revise Report' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Revise Report' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Review Report' event, with no other events in between. This tightly coupled sequence ensures that the review and revision processes are directly linked, leaving no room for delays or intervening activities.  
2. Whenever a 'Collect Feedback' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Create Action Plan' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Create Action Plan' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Collect Feedback' event, with no other events in between. This must happen within 7 days, ensuring that feedback collection and action planning are closely aligned.  
3. Whenever a 'Create Action Plan' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Implement Actions' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever an 'Implement Actions' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Create Action Plan' event, with no other events in between. This must happen within 30 days, ensuring that the action plan is promptly executed to address the feedback received.

---

### **Immediate Ordering Constraints**

#### **Chain Response Constraints**  
1. Whenever an 'Analyze Data' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Draft Report' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. This ensures a direct cause-and-effect relationship where data analysis directly leads to the creation of a draft report.  
2. Whenever an 'Approve Report' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Publish Report' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. This ensures that the approval and publication of the report occur in immediate succession, leaving no room for delays or intervening activities.

#### **Chain Succession Constraints**  
1. Whenever a 'Review Report' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Revise Report' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Revise Report' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Review Report' event, with no other events in between. This tightly coupled sequence ensures that the review and revision processes are directly linked, leaving no room for delays or intervening activities.  
2. Whenever a 'Collect Feedback' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Create Action Plan' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Create Action Plan' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Collect Feedback' event, with no other events in between. This must happen within 7 days, ensuring that feedback collection and action planning are closely aligned.  
3. Whenever a 'Create Action Plan' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Implement Actions' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever an 'Implement Actions' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Create Action Plan' event, with no other events in between. This must happen within 30 days, ensuring that the action plan is promptly executed to address the feedback received.
