The Multi-Perspective Declare model describes a structured investment lifecycle process, capturing the sequence, dependencies, and constraints between various activities. Below is a natural language description of the model:

---

### **Overview of the Investment Lifecycle Process**
The process begins with identifying an investment opportunity and progresses through due diligence, deal structuring, funding, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, ultimately concluding with feedback collection and planning for the next investment. The model defines specific rules and constraints to ensure a logical and efficient flow of activities, while also binding key data attributes to certain activities for contextual relevance.

---

### **Activities and Their Data Bindings**
1. **Identify Impact Opportunity**: This activity initiates the process and is associated with an *Opportunity ID* (an integer between 1 and 99,999).
2. **Conduct Due Diligence**: This step evaluates the opportunity and is linked to the *Opportunity ID* and a *Risk Level* (Low, Medium, or High).
3. **Structure Deal**: The deal is structured based on the findings from due diligence.
4. **Secure Funding**: Funding is secured from investors, with data attributes including *Investor ID* (integer between 1 and 9,999) and *Investment Amount* (float between 1,000 and 10,000,000).
5. **Negotiate Terms**: Terms of the deal are negotiated.
6. **Finalize Agreement**: The agreement is finalized, marking the conclusion of negotiations.
7. **Implement Investment**: The investment is implemented following the finalized agreement.
8. **Monitor Progress**: Progress is monitored during the implementation phase.
9. **Measure Impact**: The impact of the investment is measured using an *Impact Metric* (Social, Environmental, or Economic).
10. **Report Impact**: The measured impact is reported.
11. **Exit Investment**: The investment is exited using an *Exit Strategy* (Acquisition, Public Offering, or Liquidation).
12. **Distribute Returns**: Returns are distributed to investors, with data attributes including *Expected ROI* (float between 0 and 100) and *Investor ID*.
13. **Evaluate Performance**: The performance of the investment is evaluated using a *Performance Score* (integer between 1 and 10).
14. **Gather Feedback**: Feedback is collected from stakeholders, categorized as *Positive*, *Neutral*, or *Negative*.
15. **Plan Next Investment**: The process concludes with planning for the next investment.

### **Constraints and Dependencies**
The model enforces the following rules to guide the sequence and relationships between activities:

1. **Initialization**: The process always starts with the activity *Identify Impact Opportunity*.
2. **Response Constraints**:
   - After identifying an opportunity, *Conduct Due Diligence* must follow.
   - If *Negotiate Terms* occurs, it must be followed by *Finalize Agreement*.
   - After *Monitor Progress*, the impact must be measured (*Measure Impact*).
   - Reporting the impact (*Report Impact*) must be followed by exiting the investment (*Exit Investment*).
   - After distributing returns (*Distribute Returns*), the performance must be evaluated (*Evaluate Performance*).
   - After gathering feedback (*Gather Feedback*), the next investment must be planned (*Plan Next Investment*).
3. **Precedence Constraints**:
   - *Conduct Due Diligence* must occur before *Secure Funding*.
   - *Measure Impact* must occur before *Report Impact*.
4. **Chain Succession Constraints**:
   - *Finalize Agreement* must be immediately followed by *Implement Investment*.
   - *Exit Investment* must be immediately followed by *Distribute Returns*.
5. **Existence Constraints**:
   - *Monitor Progress* must occur at least once during the process.
6. **Absence Constraints**:
   - *Negotiate Terms* is not allowed to occur in the process.
7. **Not Co-Existence Constraints**:
   - *Finalize Agreement* and *Secure Funding* cannot occur together in the same process instance.
8. **End Constraint**:
   - The process must end with the activity *Gather Feedback*.

### **Data Attribute Constraints**
The model also defines specific constraints for the data attributes associated with activities:
- *Opportunity ID*: Must be an integer between 1 and 99,999.
- *Expected ROI*: Must be a float between 0 and 100.
- *Risk Level*: Must be one of the values (Low, Medium, High).
- *Investor ID*: Must be an integer between 1 and 9,999.
- *Investment Amount*: Must be a float between 1,000 and 10,000,000.
- *Impact Metric*: Must be one of the values (Social, Environmental, Economic).
- *Stakeholder Feedback*: Must be one of the values (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- *Exit Strategy*: Must be one of the values (Acquisition, Public Offering, Liquidation).
- *Performance Score*: Must be an integer between 1 and 10.

### **Summary**
This Multi-Perspective Declare model provides a comprehensive framework for managing the lifecycle of an investment process. It ensures that activities are executed in a logical order, enforces necessary dependencies, and incorporates key data attributes to maintain contextual relevance. The constraints and rules embedded in the model help streamline the process, minimize risks, and ensure alignment with strategic objectives.
