## Constraints
- **Init[Identify Impact Opportunity] | |**: The 'Identify Impact Opportunity' must be the first activity to occur in the process.
- **Response[Identify Impact Opportunity, Conduct Due Diligence] | | |**: If 'Identify Impact Opportunity' activity occurs, then 'Conduct Due Diligence' activity must eventually occur after the 'Identify Impact Opportunity' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **Absence[Negotiate Terms] | |**: The 'Negotiate Terms' must not occur in the process.
- **Response[Negotiate Terms, Finalize Agreement] | | |**: If 'Negotiate Terms' activity occurs, then 'Finalize Agreement' activity must eventually occur after the 'Negotiate Terms' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **Precedence[Secure Funding, Conduct Due Diligence] | | |**: The 'Secure Funding' activity is permitted to occur only if a 'Conduct Due Diligence' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance.
- **Chain Succession[Finalize Agreement, Implement Investment] | | |**: Whenever a 'Finalize Agreement' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Implement Investment' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever an 'Implement Investment' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Finalize Agreement' event, with no other events in between.
- **Existence[Monitor Progress] | |**: The 'Monitor Progress' activity must occur at least once in the process.
- **Response[Monitor Progress, Measure Impact] | | |**: If 'Monitor Progress' activity occurs, then 'Measure Impact' activity must eventually occur after the 'Monitor Progress' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **Precedence[Measure Impact, Report Impact] | | |0,7,d**: The 'Measure Impact' activity is permitted to occur only if a 'Report Impact' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This must happen within 0 to 7 days.
- **Response[Report Impact, Exit Investment] | | |**: If 'Report Impact' activity occurs, then 'Exit Investment' activity must eventually occur after the 'Report Impact' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **Chain Succession[Exit Investment, Distribute Returns] | | |**: Whenever an 'Exit Investment' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Distribute Returns' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Distribute Returns' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by an 'Exit Investment' event, with no other events in between.
- **Response[Distribute Returns, Evaluate Performance] | | |**: If 'Distribute Returns' activity occurs, then 'Evaluate Performance' activity must eventually occur after the 'Distribute Returns' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **End[Gather Feedback] | |**: The 'Gather Feedback' must be the last activity to occur in the process.
- **Response[Gather Feedback, Plan Next Investment] | | |**: If 'Gather Feedback' activity occurs, then 'Plan Next Investment' activity must eventually occur after the 'Gather Feedback' event at some point in the same process instance.
- **Not Co-Existence[Finalize Agreement, Secure Funding] | | |**: The 'Finalize Agreement' activity and the 'Secure Funding' activity cannot both occur within the same process instance. This means that if 'Finalize Agreement' event occurs one or more times, 'Secure Funding' must not occur at all in that process instance, and vice-versa. It is acceptable for neither event to occur. The constraint enforces a mutual exclusion between 'Finalize Agreement' and 'Secure Funding', allowing for different process variants based on which event (if any) occurs.


## Interleaved Description
The MP-Declare process model for the investment lifecycle process is described as follows:

### **Trace-Related Constraints**

#### **Init Constraints**
The process begins with the activity 'Identify Impact Opportunity,' which involves identifying potential opportunities for impactful investments. This activity sets the foundation for the entire process by ensuring that a unique 'Opportunity ID' is assigned to each investment opportunity, establishing the initial context for subsequent activities.

#### **End Constraints**
The process concludes with the activity 'Gather Feedback,' which involves collecting input and opinions from stakeholders about the investment. This activity must be the last to occur in the process, ensuring that the process ends with a comprehensive evaluation of stakeholder perspectives, thereby closing the model coherently.

---

### **Frequency Constraints**

#### **Existence Constraints**
The 'Monitor Progress' activity must occur at least once in the process. This ensures that the performance and outcomes of the investment are tracked, adding depth and reliability to the process by emphasizing the importance of ongoing oversight.

#### **Absence Constraints**
The 'Negotiate Terms' activity must not occur in the process. This exclusion highlights the integrity of the process by specifying that discussions and agreements on the terms of the investment are not permissible, ensuring that the process adheres to predefined structures.

---

### **Flexible Ordering Constraints**

#### **Precedence Constraints**
1. The activity 'Secure Funding' is permitted to occur only if a 'Conduct Due Diligence' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This ensures that the risks and opportunities associated with a potential investment are thoroughly assessed before obtaining the necessary financial resources, guiding the logical sequence within the model.

2. The activity 'Measure Impact' is permitted to occur only if a 'Report Impact' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This must happen within 0 to 7 days, ensuring that the evaluation of the investment's impact is based on documented and shared results, promoting a cohesive temporal structure.

#### **Response Constraints**
1. If the 'Identify Impact Opportunity' activity occurs, then the 'Conduct Due Diligence' activity must eventually occur after the 'Identify Impact Opportunity' event at some point in the same process instance. This ensures a logical progression where opportunities are followed by a thorough assessment.

2. If the 'Monitor Progress' activity occurs, then the 'Measure Impact' activity must eventually occur after the 'Monitor Progress' event at some point in the same process instance. This sequence ensures that tracking performance is followed by evaluating the investment's impact.

3. If the 'Report Impact' activity occurs, then the 'Exit Investment' activity must eventually occur after the 'Report Impact' event at some point in the same process instance. This ensures that the process transitions from documenting results to planning and executing the exit strategy.

4. If the 'Distribute Returns' activity occurs, then the 'Evaluate Performance' activity must eventually occur after the 'Distribute Returns' event at some point in the same process instance. This ensures that the allocation of returns is followed by an assessment of the overall performance of the investment.

5. If the 'Gather Feedback' activity occurs, then the 'Plan Next Investment' activity must eventually occur after the 'Gather Feedback' event at some point in the same process instance. This ensures that stakeholder input informs the strategy and preparation for future investment opportunities.

#### **Succession Constraints**
1. Whenever a 'Finalize Agreement' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Implement Investment' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever an 'Implement Investment' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by a 'Finalize Agreement' event, ensuring a tightly coupled sequence that establishes a direct causal link between finalizing the agreement and executing the investment plan.

2. Whenever an 'Exit Investment' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Distribute Returns' activity, with no other events in between. Conversely, whenever a 'Distribute Returns' event occurs, it must be immediately preceded by an 'Exit Investment' event, ensuring a seamless progression from exiting the investment to allocating the returns.

---

### **Exclusivity Constraints**

#### **Not Co-Existence Constraints**
The 'Finalize Agreement' activity and the 'Secure Funding' activity cannot both occur within the same process instance. This exclusion ensures that the process maintains integrity by preventing conflicting events, allowing for different process variants based on whether the investment deal is finalized or funding is secured.
