The Multi-Perspective Declare model describes a process for handling cargo, detailing the sequence of activities, constraints, and data bindings involved in the workflow. Below is a natural language description of the model:

---

### **Overview of Activities**
The process involves the following activities:
1. **Receive Cargo**: The cargo is received and identified by a unique Cargo ID.
2. **Inspect Cargo**: The cargo is inspected by an inspector, with results recorded as either "Clear" or "Hold."
3. **Document Cargo**: Documentation is created or updated for the cargo, with a status of "Completed" or "Incomplete."
4. **Scan Cargo**: The cargo is scanned, and its weight is recorded.
5. **Clear Cargo**: The cargo is cleared for further processing.
6. **Hold Cargo**: The cargo is held if issues are identified during inspection.
7. **Report Findings**: Findings related to prohibited items are reported.
8. **Notify Authorities**: Authorities are notified if prohibited items are found, with a notification status of "Notified" or "Not Notified."
9. **Release Cargo**: The cargo is released for dispatch.
10. **Archive Documentation**: Documentation for the cargo is archived after release.
11. **Dispatch Cargo**: The cargo is dispatched to its destination.
12. **Log Entry**: An entry is logged to initiate the process.

### **Data Bindings**
Each activity is associated with specific data attributes:
- **Receive Cargo**: Bound to a unique Cargo ID.
- **Inspect Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID, Inspector ID, and Inspection Result (Clear or Hold).
- **Document Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID and Documentation Status (Completed or Incomplete).
- **Scan Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID and Cargo Weight (a float between 0.1 and 10,000).
- **Clear Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID.
- **Hold Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID.
- **Report Findings**: Bound to Cargo ID and whether a Prohibited Item was Found (Yes or No).
- **Notify Authorities**: Bound to Cargo ID, Prohibited Item Found, and Notification Status (Notified or Not Notified).
- **Release Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID.
- **Archive Documentation**: Bound to Cargo ID and Documentation Status.
- **Dispatch Cargo**: Bound to Cargo ID.
- **Log Entry**: Bound to Cargo ID.

### **Constraints and Workflow Rules**
The process is governed by the following constraints and rules:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The process starts with the activity **Log Entry**.

2. **Activity Precedence and Dependencies**:
   - **Inspect Cargo** must occur after **Log Entry**.
   - **Document Cargo** must occur before **Inspect Cargo**.
   - **Scan Cargo** must occur before **Clear Cargo**.
   - **Release Cargo** must occur after **Notify Authorities**.

3. **Activity Chains**:
   - If **Hold Cargo** occurs, it must be immediately followed by **Report Findings**.
   - If **Report Findings** occurs, it must be immediately followed by **Notify Authorities**.
   - If **Release Cargo** occurs, it must be immediately followed by **Archive Documentation**.

4. **Responses**:
   - If **Clear Cargo** occurs, it must be followed by **Release Cargo**.
   - If **Release Cargo** occurs, it must be followed by both **Dispatch Cargo** and **Archive Documentation**.

5. **Existence Constraints**:
   - **Clear Cargo** must occur at least twice in the process.
   - **Release Cargo** must occur at least once.

6. **Co-Existence**:
   - If **Scan Cargo** occurs, then **Inspect Cargo** must also occur (and vice versa).

7. **Termination**:
   - The process ends with the activity **Dispatch Cargo**.

8. **Absence**:
   - The activity **Document Cargo** must not occur more than once.

### **Data Constraints**
- **Cargo ID**: An integer between 1 and 999,999 uniquely identifies each cargo.
- **Cargo Weight**: A float between 0.1 and 10,000 represents the weight of the cargo.
- **Inspector ID**: An integer between 1 and 9,999 identifies the inspector.
- **Inspection Result**: Can be either "Clear" or "Hold."
- **Prohibited Item Found**: Can be either "Yes" or "No."
- **Notification Status**: Can be either "Notified" or "Not Notified."
- **Documentation Status**: Can be either "Completed" or "Incomplete."

### **Summary**
This model outlines a structured process for handling cargo, ensuring that all necessary steps (e.g., inspection, documentation, scanning, and clearance) are completed in a specific order. It enforces strict rules for activity dependencies, co-occurrences, and data integrity, while also ensuring that prohibited items are reported and authorities are notified when necessary. The process concludes with the release, documentation, and dispatch of the cargo.
