## Constraints
- **Existence[Conduct Safety Training] | |**: The 'Conduct Safety Training' activity must occur at least once in the process.
- **Exactly2[Inspect Safety Equipment] | |**: The 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity must occur exactly 2 times in the process.
- **Response[Report Safety Incident, Investigate Safety Breach] | | |0,2,d**: If a 'Report Safety Incident' activity occurs, then an 'Investigate Safety Breach' activity must eventually occur after the 'Report Safety Incident' event at some point in the same process instance, within a time frame of 0 to 2 days.
- **Co-Existence[Conduct Emergency Drill, Review Safety Reports] | | |**: If 'Conduct Emergency Drill' activity occurs, then 'Review Safety Reports' must also occur in the same process instance, and vice versa.
- **Precedence[Implement Safety Measures, Approve Safety Budget] | | |**: The 'Implement Safety Measures' activity is permitted to occur only if an 'Approve Safety Budget' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance.
- **Exclusive Choice[Conduct Safety Training, Certify Safety Personnel] | | |**: Exactly one of the activities 'Conduct Safety Training' or 'Certify Safety Personnel' must occur in the process instance. This means that the process is compliant if only 'Conduct Safety Training' event occurs without any occurrence of 'Certify Safety Personnel' event, or only 'Certify Safety Personnel' occurs without any occurrence of 'Conduct Safety Training'. The process is non-compliant if both 'Conduct Safety Training' and 'Certify Safety Personnel' occur, or if neither occurs.
- **Response[Perform Risk Assessment, Implement Safety Measures] | | |0,48,h**: If a 'Perform Risk Assessment' activity occurs, then an 'Implement Safety Measures' activity must eventually occur after the 'Perform Risk Assessment' event at some point in the same process instance, within a time frame of 0 to 48 hours.
- **End[Update Safety Policies] | |**: The 'Update Safety Policies' must be the last activity to occur in the process.
- **Succession[Monitor Safety Performance, Review Safety Reports] | | |**: A 'Monitor Safety Performance' activity must be followed by a 'Review Safety Reports' activity at some point later in the same process instance. Conversely, a 'Review Safety Reports' event can occur only if a 'Monitor Safety Performance' event has occurred before it within the same process instance. This bidirectional and ordered dependency ensures that 'Monitor Safety Performance' imposes obligations for future 'Review Safety Reports', and 'Review Safety Reports' cannot occur without prior 'Monitor Safety Performance'. Multiple 'Monitor Safety Performance' and 'Review Safety Reports' are allowed, with each 'Monitor Safety Performance' eventually leading to a 'Review Safety Reports' and each 'Review Safety Reports' being justified by a preceding 'Monitor Safety Performance'.
- **Chain Response[Schedule Safety Audit, Evaluate Safety Compliance] | | |**: Whenever a 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Evaluate Safety Compliance' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. The 'Evaluate Safety Compliance' activity is allowed to happen isolated.
- **Not Chain Succession[Communicate Safety Updates, Conduct Safety Training] | | |**: A 'Communicate Safety Updates' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Conduct Safety Training' activity; there must be at least one other event between them. Similarly, a 'Conduct Safety Training' event cannot be immediately preceded by a 'Communicate Safety Updates' event. This constraint allows multiple occurrences of 'Communicate Safety Updates' and 'Conduct Safety Training' in any order, provided they are not adjacent in the event sequence.
- **Responded Existence[Report Safety Incident, Investigate Safety Breach] |A.Incident Severity > 3 | |**: If 'Report Safety Incident' activity occurs in a process instance, then 'Investigate Safety Breach' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance, either before or after the 'Report Safety Incident' event, provided the 'Incident Severity' attribute of the 'Report Safety Incident' activity is greater than 3. If 'Report Safety Incident' does not occur, there is no requirement for 'Investigate Safety Breach' to occur. Multiple occurrences of 'Report Safety Incident' are satisfied by at least one occurrence of 'Investigate Safety Breach', and multiple 'Investigate Safety Breach' instances are allowed.
- **Choice[Conduct Emergency Drill, Monitor Safety Performance] | | |**: At least one of the activities 'Conduct Emergency Drill' or 'Monitor Safety Performance' must occur in the process instance. This means that the process is compliant if 'Conduct Emergency Drill' event occurs, 'Monitor Safety Performance' event occurs, or both occur. There is no restriction on the order or the number of times they occur. However, if neither 'Conduct Emergency Drill' nor 'Monitor Safety Performance' occurs, the constraint is violated.
- **Responded Existence[Inspect Safety Equipment, Inspect Safety Equipment] |A.Safety Equipment Status is Needs Repair | |**: If 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity occurs in a process instance, then 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance, either before or after the 'Inspect Safety Equipment' event, provided the 'Safety Equipment Status' attribute of the 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity is 'Needs Repair'. If 'Inspect Safety Equipment' does not occur, there is no requirement for 'Inspect Safety Equipment' to occur. Multiple occurrences of 'Inspect Safety Equipment' are satisfied by at least one occurrence of 'Inspect Safety Equipment', and multiple 'Inspect Safety Equipment' instances are allowed.
- **Response[Schedule Safety Audit, Schedule Safety Audit] |A.Audit Frequency is Monthly | |0,30,d**: If a 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity occurs, then a 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity must eventually occur after the 'Schedule Safety Audit' event at some point in the same process instance, within a time frame of 0 to 30 days, provided the 'Audit Frequency' attribute of the 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity is 'Monthly'.


## Interleaved Description
The MP-Declare process model for the safety management process is described as follows:

### **Trace-Related Constraints**

#### **Init Constraints**
The process begins with the activity 'Conduct Safety Training,' which involves organizing and delivering training sessions to educate participants on safety protocols and procedures. This activity must occur at least once in the process, establishing the foundational context for safety awareness and preparedness.

#### **End Constraints**
The process concludes with the activity 'Update Safety Policies,' which involves revising and updating safety policies to reflect current standards and requirements. This activity must be the last to occur in the process, ensuring that all safety-related updates are finalized and documented coherently.

---

### **Frequency Constraints**

#### **Existence Constraints**
The 'Conduct Safety Training' activity must occur at least once in the process. This ensures that safety training is conducted to educate participants, adding depth and reliability to the process by emphasizing the importance of safety awareness.

#### **Exactly Constraints**
The 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity must occur exactly 2 times in the process. This sets a fixed boundary on the number of inspections, ensuring precision and consistency in verifying the operational status of safety equipment.

---

### **Dependency Constraints**

#### **Responded Existence Constraints**
1. If the 'Report Safety Incident' activity occurs with the condition that the 'Incident Severity' attribute is greater than 3, then the 'Investigate Safety Breach' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance. This establishes a dependency where severe incidents necessitate an investigation, enhancing coherence and accountability in the process.
2. If the 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity occurs with the condition that the 'Safety Equipment Status' attribute is 'Needs Repair,' then another 'Inspect Safety Equipment' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance. This ensures that equipment requiring repair is re-inspected, maintaining safety standards and operational readiness.

---

### **Flexible Ordering Constraints**

#### **Precedence Constraints**
1. The activity 'Implement Safety Measures' is permitted to occur only if an 'Approve Safety Budget' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. This ensures that safety measures are implemented only after the necessary budget has been approved, guiding the logical sequence of resource allocation and action.

#### **Response Constraints**
1. If a 'Report Safety Incident' activity occurs, then an 'Investigate Safety Breach' activity must eventually occur after the 'Report Safety Incident' event at some point in the same process instance, within a time frame of 0 to 2 days. This defines an ordered flow where incidents are promptly followed by investigations, ensuring a cohesive temporal structure in the process.
2. If a 'Perform Risk Assessment' activity occurs, then an 'Implement Safety Measures' activity must eventually occur after the 'Perform Risk Assessment' event at some point in the same process instance, within a time frame of 0 to 48 hours. This ensures that identified risks are addressed in a timely manner, maintaining the process's momentum.

#### **Succession Constraints**
Whenever a 'Monitor Safety Performance' activity occurs, it must be followed by a 'Review Safety Reports' activity at some point later in the same process instance. Conversely, a 'Review Safety Reports' event can occur only if a 'Monitor Safety Performance' event has occurred before it. This bidirectional and ordered dependency ensures that monitoring safety performance imposes obligations for future reviews, and reviews are justified by prior monitoring, creating a cohesive progression within the model.

---

### **Immediate Ordering Constraints**

#### **Chain Response Constraints**
Whenever a 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by an 'Evaluate Safety Compliance' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. This captures an immediate cause-and-effect relationship, ensuring that audits are directly succeeded by compliance evaluations, making the sequence explicit and precise.

#### **Not Chain Response Constraints**
A 'Communicate Safety Updates' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Conduct Safety Training' activity; there must be at least one other event between them. Similarly, a 'Conduct Safety Training' event cannot be immediately preceded by a 'Communicate Safety Updates' event. This prevents immediate succession, preserving structural integrity in the sequence.

---

### **Mutual Dependency Constraints**

#### **Co-Existence Constraints**
If the 'Conduct Emergency Drill' activity occurs, then the 'Review Safety Reports' activity must also occur in the same process instance, and vice versa. This establishes mutual dependency, ensuring that emergency drills and safety report reviews occur together within the process flow.

---

### **Exclusivity Constraints**

#### **Choice Constraints**
At least one of the activities 'Conduct Emergency Drill' or 'Monitor Safety Performance' must occur in the process instance. This allows flexibility by permitting either activity to occur, ensuring that safety preparedness or performance monitoring is addressed.

#### **Exclusive Choice Constraints**
Exactly one of the activities 'Conduct Safety Training' or 'Certify Safety Personnel' must occur in the process instance. This enforces mutually exclusive pathways, ensuring that either safety training is conducted or personnel are certified, but not both, maintaining process integrity by avoiding redundancy.

---

### **Negative Dependency Constraints**

#### **Not Chain Succession Constraints**
A 'Communicate Safety Updates' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Conduct Safety Training' activity, and vice versa. This prevents direct succession, ensuring that these activities are not adjacent in the event sequence, thereby refining the process model by excluding specific immediate sequences.

---

### **Negative Flexible Ordering Constraints**

#### **Not Response Constraints**
If a 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity occurs with the condition that the 'Audit Frequency' attribute is 'Monthly,' then another 'Schedule Safety Audit' activity must eventually occur after the first within a time frame of 0 to 30 days. This ensures that audits are scheduled consistently and in accordance with the specified frequency, maintaining the intended progression of the process.
