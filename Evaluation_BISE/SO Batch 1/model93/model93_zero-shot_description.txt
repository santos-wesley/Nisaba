The Multi-Perspective Declare model describes a structured process for managing donor relationships and securing agreements, with specific constraints and conditions governing the sequence and attributes of activities. Below is a natural language description of the model:

---

### Overview of Activities:
1. **Identify Donor**: The process begins with identifying a donor, assigning a unique integer ID between 1 and 1000.
2. **Initiate Contact**: Contact is initiated with the donor using one of three methods: Email, Phone, or In-Person.
3. **Conduct Meeting**: A meeting is conducted with the donor, lasting between 15 and 180 minutes.
4. **Draft Proposal**: A proposal is drafted, specifying the donor ID, a donation amount (between 1,000.0 and 1,000,000.0), and the proposal status (Drafted, Reviewed, Approved, or Submitted).
5. **Review Proposal**: The drafted proposal is reviewed, updating its status.
6. **Approve Proposal**: The reviewed proposal is approved, further updating its status.
7. **Submit Proposal**: The approved proposal is submitted to the donor.
8. **Receive Feedback**: Feedback is received from the donor, categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
9. **Negotiate Terms**: Based on the feedback, terms are negotiated with the donor.
10. **Finalize Agreement**: The process concludes with the finalization of an agreement, which can have a status of either Pending or Finalized.

### Constraints and Rules:
1. **Initialization and Termination**:
   - The process must start with the activity **Identify Donor**.
   - The process must end with the activity **Finalize Agreement**.

2. **Mandatory Activities**:
   - The activity **Review Proposal** must occur at least once during the process.

3. **Precedence Relationships**:
   - **Submit Proposal** must be preceded by **Approve Proposal**, and both activities must involve the same donor (matching Donor ID).
   - **Review Proposal** must be preceded by **Draft Proposal**, and both activities must involve the same donor.

4. **Response Relationships**:
   - If **Receive Feedback** occurs, it must be followed by **Negotiate Terms** within 2 days, and both activities must involve the same donor.
   - **Conduct Meeting** must be immediately followed by **Draft Proposal** within 48 hours, and both activities must involve the same donor.

5. **Co-Existence Relationships**:
   - If **Initiate Contact** occurs using the **Phone** method, then **Conduct Meeting** must also occur, and both activities must use the same contact method.

6. **Responded Existence**:
   - If **Submit Proposal** occurs, then **Receive Feedback** must also occur, and both activities must involve the same donor.

7. **Negative Constraints**:
   - If **Receive Feedback** results in **Negative** feedback, it cannot be immediately followed by **Finalize Agreement** for the same donor.

### Data Bindings and Attributes:
- Each activity is associated with specific attributes:
  - **Identify Donor**: Donor ID (integer between 1 and 1000).
  - **Initiate Contact**: Donor ID and Contact Method (Email, Phone, or In-Person).
  - **Conduct Meeting**: Donor ID and Meeting Duration (15–180 minutes).
  - **Draft Proposal**: Donor ID, Donation Amount (1,000.0–1,000,000.0), and Proposal Status (Drafted, Reviewed, Approved, or Submitted).
  - **Review Proposal**: Donor ID and Proposal Status.
  - **Approve Proposal**: Donor ID and Proposal Status.
  - **Submit Proposal**: Donor ID and Proposal Status.
  - **Receive Feedback**: Donor ID and Feedback Type (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
  - **Negotiate Terms**: Donor ID and Feedback Type.
  - **Finalize Agreement**: Donor ID and Agreement Status (Pending or Finalized).

### Summary:
This model ensures a structured and traceable process for managing donor interactions, from identifying a donor to finalizing an agreement. It enforces logical sequencing of activities, ensures consistency in donor-related data, and incorporates conditions based on feedback and contact methods. The constraints and rules aim to maintain process integrity while allowing flexibility within defined boundaries.
