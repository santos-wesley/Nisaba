This must happen within 2 days.
- **Chain Response[Conduct Meeting, Draft Proposal] | |A.Donor ID == T.Donor ID |0,48,h**: Whenever a 'Conduct Meeting' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Draft Proposal' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between, and the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match. This must happen within 48 hours.
- **Responded Existence[Submit Proposal, Receive Feedback] | |A.Donor ID == T.Donor ID |**: If 'Submit Proposal' activity occurs in a process instance, then 'Receive Feedback' activity must also occur at least once within the same process instance, and the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match.
- **Precedence[Review Proposal, Draft Proposal] | |A.Donor ID == T.Donor ID |**: The 'Review Proposal' activity is permitted to occur only if a 'Draft Proposal' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance, and the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match.
- **Co-Existence[Initiate Contact, Conduct Meeting] |A.Contact Method is Phone |A.Contact Method == T.Contact Method |**: If 'Initiate Contact' activity occurs, then 'Conduct Meeting' must also occur in the same process instance, and vice versa. Additionally, the 'Contact Method' attribute of 'Initiate Contact' must be 'Phone', and the 'Contact Method' attribute of both activities must match.
- **Not Chain Succession[Receive Feedback, Finalize Agreement] |A.Feedback Type is Negative |A.Donor ID == T.Donor ID |**: A 'Receive Feedback' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Finalize Agreement' activity; there must be at least one other event between them. Additionally, the 'Feedback Type' attribute of 'Receive Feedback' must be 'Negative', and the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match.


## Interleaved Description
The MP-Declare process model for the fundraising process is described as follows:

### **Trace-Related Constraints**

#### **Init Constraints**
The process begins with the activity 'Identify Donor,' which involves identifying potential donors for the fundraising process. This activity is foundational as it sets the stage for all subsequent activities by establishing the donor's identity through the 'Donor ID' attribute.

#### **End Constraints**
The process concludes with the activity 'Finalize Agreement,' which involves completing and formalizing the agreement with the donor. This activity must be the last to occur in the process, ensuring that all prior steps have been completed and the agreement is finalized, marking the successful conclusion of the fundraising process.

---

### **Frequency Constraints**

#### **Existence Constraint**
The 'Review Proposal' activity must occur at least once in the process. This ensures that the drafted proposal is evaluated for accuracy and compliance with required standards, adding depth and reliability to the process by guaranteeing that the proposal undergoes a thorough review.

---

### **Flexible Ordering Constraints**

#### **Precedence Constraints**
1. The activity 'Submit Proposal' is permitted to occur only if an 'Approve Proposal' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. Additionally, the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match. This ensures that the proposal is formally approved before being submitted to the donor, maintaining a logical and structured sequence in the process.
2. The activity 'Review Proposal' is permitted to occur only if a 'Draft Proposal' activity has occurred before it within the same process instance. The 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match, ensuring that the proposal is reviewed only after it has been drafted, thereby maintaining a coherent flow in the process.

#### **Response Constraints**
1. If a 'Receive Feedback' activity occurs, then a 'Negotiate Terms' activity must eventually occur after the 'Receive Feedback' event at some point in the same process instance. The 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match, and this must happen within 2 days. This ensures that donor feedback is promptly addressed through negotiation, maintaining the process's responsiveness and efficiency.

#### **Succession Constraints**
Whenever a 'Conduct Meeting' activity occurs, it must be immediately followed by a 'Draft Proposal' activity in the next event position, with no other events in between. The 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match, and this must happen within 48 hours. This establishes a direct causal link between the meeting and the drafting of the proposal, ensuring a seamless progression in the process.

---

### **Mutual Dependency Constraints**

#### **Co-Existence Constraints**
If the 'Initiate Contact' activity occurs, then the 'Conduct Meeting' activity must also occur in the same process instance, and vice versa. Additionally, the 'Contact Method' attribute of 'Initiate Contact' must be 'Phone,' and the 'Contact Method' attribute of both activities must match. This mutual dependency ensures that contact initiated via phone leads to a meeting, reinforcing the process's consistency and logical flow.

---

### **Exclusivity Constraints**

#### **Not Chain Succession Constraints**
A 'Receive Feedback' activity cannot be immediately followed by a 'Finalize Agreement' activity if the 'Feedback Type' attribute of 'Receive Feedback' is 'Negative.' Additionally, the 'Donor ID' attribute of both activities must match. This exclusion ensures that negative feedback is addressed through other intermediate activities before finalizing the agreement, maintaining the integrity and thoroughness of the process.

---

The MP-Declare process model for the fundraising process is designed to ensure a structured, logical, and efficient flow of activities, with clear dependencies, mutual relationships, and exclusions that maintain the integrity and coherence of the process.
